# TicTacToe 
# X vs. O
### TicTacToe exercise for B1 IT @LaPlateforme_

In this game, two players face off. 
In turn, they designate a square and alternately insert a sign ('X' and 'O').
The first player who manages to make a vertical, horizontal or diagonal alignment of three signs wins the game. 
If the game board is full of signs and there are no three alignment, then it’s a draw.
